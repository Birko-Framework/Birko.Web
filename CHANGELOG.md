# Changelog

One entry per tag, newest first. Versioning rules: [README.md § Versions](README.md#versions). Before 1.0 a
**MINOR** bump is a breaking change and its entry carries a **BREAKING** migration; PATCH versions of one MINOR are
interchangeable for consumers.

## v0.1.0 — 2026-10-10

First tagged version: the state of `main` on 2026-10-10, all four packages. Nothing before it was versioned, so it is
a baseline rather than a list of changes. Most recent work included:

- `b-qty-stepper` — form-associated quantity stepper (decimal step, min/max, unit) — Birko TASK-548
- `b-carousel` — server-rendered slides, arrows, dots, swipe, autoplay that yields — TASK-549
- `b-gallery` — product images with thumbnails, swipe and an accessible zoom — TASK-550
- `b-input` prefix / suffix slots and `clearable` — TASK-484
- `announce()` (dom-utils) — status messages through `Element.ariaNotify` with a live-region fallback
- `I18n.t()` and every `{placeholder}` path fill in one pass via `interpolate()` — TASK-551
- `b-code-block` re-renders when its text content changes — TASK-543
- `SseClient` — one retry loop, `reconnectDelays` schedule, `_failing` event (`failingAfter`, default 5) — TASK-547
